# Wine Quality Dataset

### Introduction

Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. It is a pleasant tasting alcoholic beverage, loved cellebrated . It will definitely be interesting to analyze the physicochemical attributes of wine and understand their relationships and significance with wine quality and types classifications.Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

The dataset are related to red and white variants of the "Vinho Verde" wine. Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. Medium in alcohol, is it particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer). 

### Attribute Information:

1. fixed acidity - Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
2. volatile acidity - Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine
3. citric acid - It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally
4. residual sugar - Amount of sugar left after fermentation
5. chlorides - Amount of salt present in wine
6. free sulfur dioxide - So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH - In wine pH is used for checking acidity
10. sulphates - Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria
11. alcohol -  Percent of alcohol present in wine</br>

Output variable (based on sensory data):</br>
12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
