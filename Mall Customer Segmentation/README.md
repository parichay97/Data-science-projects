# Mall Customer Segmentation
Market segmentation is the activity of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers, based on some type of shared characteristics.

Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.

Malls or shopping complexes are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and hence making huge profits. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied by many stores already. It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. The shopping complexes make use of their customersâ€™ data and develop ML models to target the right ones. This not only increases sales but also makes the complexes efficient.

Clustering is a branch of unsupervised machine learning where the goal is to identify groups or clusters in your data set without the use of labels. Clustering should not be considered the same as classification. We are not trying make predictions on observations from a set of pre-defined classes. In clustering, you are identifying a set of similar data points and calling the resulting set a cluster.

Let's consider an example of clustering. You may have a data set characterizing your customers like demographic information and personal preferences. A supervised machine learning task would be to predict which class a person belongs to: customers who will purchase your product and customers who won't. In contrast, an unsupervised machine learning task would be to identify several groups or types of customers. With these groups identified, you can analyze the groups and build profiles describing the groups. For example, one group tends to include people from the ages 20 to 25 who like the outdoors. With these profiles, you can pass that information and analysis to the marketing team to create different advertisements to best attract each group.
Content
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

## Problem Statement<br>
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge(Target Customers) so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.
